Dekubot is a general purpose discord chat-bot. It performs various different tasks, some of which are listed below.

## Cool stuff DekuBot does

* General server utils such as having a welcome message
* Creating feeds for the new posts on a subreddit
* Works as a music bot by playing youtube links
* Tracking rss feeds
* Creating custom commands
* A whole bunch of other stuff yo

## Adding the bot to your server

* The way to add Dekubot to your server is to simply use the [Invite link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=282126217275244545&scope=bot&permissions=2146954327). From that page you can add the bot to any server where you have manage_server permissions 

* For a list of commands I recommend reading the [Wiki](https://github.com/RoddersGH/DekuBot/blob/master/docs/CommandsList.md) we have here on this repository as it has a comprehensive list of every command and how they can be used

* If you have any further questions or you want to help in the development of DekuBot then please join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/we8bdxJ) 

## Installation

* A guide for installation will be coming shortly and I appreciate your patience
